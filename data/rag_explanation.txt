Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods in natural language processing. 

The core idea behind RAG is to enhance language model responses by first retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base or document collection, then using this retrieved context to generate more accurate and informative responses.

The RAG process typically involves three main components:

1. **Retrieval Component**: This uses embedding-based similarity search to find relevant documents or passages from a vector database. The query is converted to an embedding, and similar document embeddings are retrieved using cosine similarity or other distance metrics.

2. **Augmentation Component**: The retrieved documents are formatted and combined with the original query to create an augmented prompt that provides context for the generation model.

3. **Generation Component**: A large language model uses the augmented prompt (query + retrieved context) to generate a response that is grounded in the retrieved information.

Benefits of RAG include:
- Access to up-to-date information beyond the model's training cutoff
- Reduced hallucination by grounding responses in retrieved facts
- Ability to cite sources and provide transparent reasoning
- Scalability to large knowledge bases without retraining models

RAG systems are particularly useful for question-answering, content generation, and knowledge-intensive tasks where accuracy and factual grounding are important.
