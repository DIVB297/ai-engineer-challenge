# Project Development Notes

## Assumptions and Decisions Made

### Database Choice
- **Assumption**: Using MongoDB Atlas (cloud) instead of local CLI-based MongoDB for better performance and reliability
- **Reasoning**: Cloud-based solution provides better scalability, managed services, and eliminates local setup complexity

### Training Data
- **Source**: Utilized ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot for generating training data
- **Purpose**: Created realistic QA pairs and sample documents for the LoRA fine-tuning demonstration
- **Quality**: All generated content was reviewed and validated for accuracy

### Documentation
- **Tool**: Utilized GitHub Copilot for documentation creation assistance
- **Review Process**: All documentation was personally reviewed and edited for accuracy and completeness
- **Coverage**: Created comprehensive documentation including API references, deployment guides, and architecture explanations

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Challenge**: Encountered multiple failures during initial CI/CD setup attempts
- **Solution**: After extensive troubleshooting, utilized GPT assistance to resolve complex Docker build issues, linting conflicts, and GitHub Actions configuration
- **Result**: Successfully implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, building, and deployment

## Project Completion Status

 **Fully Completed** - All requirements have been implemented and tested

### Key Deliverables

1. **Architecture & Local Setup**
   - Complete RAG system with microservices architecture
   - Docker Compose setup for easy local deployment
   - Detailed instructions in `README.md` at root level

2. **API Documentation**
   - Comprehensive API reference in `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`
   - Copy-paste ready curl commands for all endpoints
   - Complete parameter documentation and example responses

3. **AWS Deployment Guide**
   - Step-by-step AWS deployment instructions in `docs/aws-deployment-guide.md`
   - Lambda, ECS, EC2, and SageMaker deployment options
   - Production considerations and scaling strategies

4. **Multi-Vector Similarity Support**
   - Both cosine similarity and dot product similarity metrics
   - Performance comparison tools and benchmarking scripts
   - Complete testing suite for similarity metrics

5. **LoRA Fine-tuning**
   - Complete PEFT adapter training implementation
   - Interactive inference capabilities
   - Toy QA dataset with realistic examples

6. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated linting, testing, and building
   - Docker image building and pushing to GitHub Container Registry
   - Security scanning with Trivy
   - Multi-stage deployment workflow

## Development Approach

### Tools Utilized
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code generation, documentation assistance, debugging support
- **ChatGPT**: Training data generation, complex problem solving, CI/CD troubleshooting
- **Personal Review**: All AI-generated content was manually reviewed and validated

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing suite with unit tests and integration tests
- Manual testing of all API endpoints and workflows
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment

## Final Notes

The project demonstrates a production-ready RAG system with advanced features including:
- Multi-vector similarity support
- Complete CI/CD pipeline
- Comprehensive documentation
- AWS deployment readiness 
- LoRA fine-tuning capabilities

All components have been thoroughly tested and documented. The system is ready for production deployment following the guides provided in the `docs/` folder.

Note: I use documentation, open-source code, GPT, and GitHub Copilot as references, but the project is fully built by me. These resources help me debug issues, address errors, and explore unfamiliar areas (such as adding Jest test cases).
